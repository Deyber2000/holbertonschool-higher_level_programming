[3. String Representation](./3-rectangle.py) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 2 with width, height, area, perimeter and print() and str() print '#' character
[4. Eval is magic](./4-rectangle.py) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 3 with repr() returning string representation of rectangle to be able to recreate new instance using eval()
[5. Detect Instance Deletion](./5-rectangle.py) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 4 that prints "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted
[6. How Many Instances](./6-rectangle.py) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 5 that has number_of_instances attribute that is incremented during each new instance instantiation
[7. Change Representation](./7-rectangle.py) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 6 that has public class attribute print_symbol used as symbol for string representation (initialized to '#')
[8. Compare Rectangles](./8-rectangle.py) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 7 that adds static method bigger_or_equal(rect_1, rect_2) that returns the biggest rectangle based on area
[9. A Square is a Rectangle](./9-rectangle) | Class 'Rectangle' based on 8 that adds class method square(cls, size=0) that returns new Rectangle instance with width == height == size
